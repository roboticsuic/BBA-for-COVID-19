## PROJECT: **Bioengineered breathing assistant for COVID-19**
This project is based on the manufacture of a breathing assistant for COVID-19, a device designed to help those suffering severe breathing difficulties while affected by COVID-19. The aim of this project is to report how we created an electric device with the ability to provide sufficient oxygen to those patients.

The overall mechanism consists in... (not finished)

The project is developed on the basis of a previous project that we found in Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4255247), where we got the breathing assistant model that we decided to print in 3D. In addition, we printed two extra pieces: (1) a display adapted box, where we will fit the display and place all the electronics of the mechanism; and (2) an extra support for the pump end.


_1. Objectives_: 
- Learn the basics of 3D printing and electronics in order to create a bioengineered breathing assistant for COVID-19.
- Create an accessible and fast 3D printed device in order to cover the urgent necessities during the pandemia.
- Use motors and electronic devices in order to understand its functions.

_2. Materials_: 


_3.Softwares_: 

**SolidWorks**

 SolidWorks is modeling a computer-aided design (CAD) program that allowed us to create the breath assistant's structure quickly and precisely. The whole structure is composed of 12 different pieces and all of them have to fit with each other, as this project doesn’t contain any screws or ties. However, this part didn’t require a lot of time as all the 12 pieces were previously created by another Catalan University (UPC). A maximum of five days were required for printing the whole structure. The final outcome was the following: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

On the other hand, SolidWorks was constantly used during our project due to the improvements that our group decided to do. Firstly, we wanted to incorporate our logo into certain structures, particularly in the blue ones. To do that, we used the SolidWorks program to create a new plane in the upper surface, and insert the corresponding text. The difficult part was to figure out which direction was the perfect one, due to the face-mask connector would be seen in the opposite direction. However, we resolve this drawback by far.

Secondly, this program was also used to create the needed structure to connect the breath assistant with the medical tubs. To do it, we measured the most external part of both devices with a vernier caliper, and with such dimensions, we created the connector. PHOTO

Thirdly, we decided that one of the initial 12 structures had to have all its surface with PLA. To do that, we create a new plan over the created, and we extrude it. PHOTO4

Finally, we wanted to create a box to keep all the tools together and well-organized. But this box couldn’t be as the typical ones, but with a certain orientation in one of the faces as we also have a screen to fit inside of it. Therefore, the box had to be composed of different parts. First, we had to modify a preexisting project piece so the box could be attached to the breath machine. Secondly, the back part was created and also the laterals. Finally, the screen face  was designed with all the modifications needed to be able to use all buttons. As can be seen in the image below, all parts have rectangle holes or rectangular extrusions so they can be ansamble together and form the desired box.
In order to know if the box was designed properly, we assembled all the new pieces with Solid works, and the result is the following image.  PHOTO
