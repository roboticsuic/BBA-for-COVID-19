## PROJECT: **Bioengineered breathing assistant for COVID-19**
This project is based on the manufacture of a breathing assistant for COVID-19, a device designed to help those suffering severe breathing difficulties while affected by COVID-19. The aim of this project is to report how we created an electric device with the ability to provide sufficient oxygen to those patients.

The overall mechanism consists in... (not finished)

The project is developed on the basis of a previous project that we found in Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4255247), where we got the breathing assistant model that we decided to print in 3D. In addition, we printed two extra pieces: (1) a display adapted box, where we will fit the display and place all the electronics of the mechanism; and (2) an extra support for the pump end.


_Objectives_: 
- Learn the basics of 3D printing and electronics in order to create a bioengineered breathing assistant for COVID-19.
- Create an accessible and fast 3D printed device in order to cover the urgent necessities during the pandemia.
- Use motors and electronic devices in order to understand its functions.
