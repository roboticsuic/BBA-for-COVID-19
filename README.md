# UIC-Easy-Breath
Bioengineered breathing assistant for COVID-19

We are a group of four girls, form UIC, trying to mimic a mechanical ventilator for COVID-19 patients.
The overall mechanism consists in a 3D printed breathing machine structure connected to several electrical devices and all derived from an Arduino MKR 1000.
