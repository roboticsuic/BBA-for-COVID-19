# Bioengineered breathing assistant for COVID-19

We are a group of four girls, form UIC, trying to mimic a mechanical ventilator for COVID-19 patients.
The overall mechanism consists in a 3D printed breathing machine structure connected to several electrical devices and all derived from an Arduino MKR 1000. There is a video of the all project in _EXTRA_ folder.

Here you will find both the 3D files in order to print the structure, and also the specific code to control it.
Remember that we are a group of undergraduates students, so this project is educational.
