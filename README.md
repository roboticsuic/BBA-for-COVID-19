# Bioengineered breathing assistant for COVID-19

We are a group of four girls, form UIC, trying to mimic a mechanical ventilator for COVID-19 patients.
The overall mechanism consists in a 3D printed breathing machine structure connected to several electrical devices and all derived from an Arduino MKR 1000.

Here you will find either the 3D files in order to print the structure, and also the specific code to control it.
Remember that we are a group of undergraduates students, so this project is educational.
